    <p> Hi! I'm Michael Newman Fortunato. Welcome to my website.
      I am currently a third year at the
      University of Chicago pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics.

      I am using this platform as a creative space to test
      new ideas, and quite frankly as a way for potential
      employers to get to learn about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest is first a foremost theoretical mathematics and computer science.
      I like math because it forces me to think cleanly and to visualize.
      Computer science allows me to approach problems with sterility and intention.
      The language of computer science and mathematics is contained,
      and so when studyinig data structures, we are given a complete
      understanding of them through the perspective of deductive logic.
      So for example, we can theoretically define and completely
      understand the concept of <b>memory</b> from the perspective of bits.
      This to me seems like a good apprach to epistemology.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that vein, my goal in life is to help create the
      first artificial intelligence.  I believe AI will be a profound good
      for the world,so long as it is designed with care,
      discretion, and patience.
      I have always been fascinated by intelligence, and I believe this undertaking
      will be a great exercise in epistemology and give us a better sense of what
      it means to know, to understand, so on. A direct consequence of this
      would be a full a complete understanding of a our brain, the most complex
      object in the universe.

      I have always believed in The Great Book and in their power
      (erroneous perhaps) to make a person more considerate, kind,
      thoughtful, curious--a better person.
      This has subsequently engendered an appreciation for language.
      There is an incredible amount of cheap, misinformed ornamentation
      in my writing (verbage, nested-clauses, etc.).
      I am not the biggest fan, and I hope to improve by starting a
      repository for my writings (writings.html) on my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this appreciatation for language resulted in my finding my specific speciality
      in AI rather quickly: Natural Language Processing and Language-Embeddings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to get a PhD in Computer Science specializing in the subfield
      of language embeddings.
      Therefore, my interests really fall in the field of natural language Processing
      machine learning, topic-modelling, concept recognition, context recognition,
      and vectorized word representations. A few of my favorite papers are
      Distributed Representations of Words (Tomas Mikolov et. al),
      Latent Dirichelect Allocation (David Blei et al),
      kAnchor Words (Sanjeev Arora et al).
