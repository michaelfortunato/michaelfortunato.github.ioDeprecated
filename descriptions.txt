<p> Hi! I'm Michael Newman Fortunato. Welcome to my website.
  I am currently a third year at the
  University of Chicago pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics.
  I am using this platform as a creative space to test
  new ideas, and quite frankly as a way for potential
  employers to get to learn about me.
</p>
<p>
  My interest is first a foremost theoretical mathematics and computer science.
  I like math because it forces me to think cleanly and to visualize.
  Computer science allows me to approach problems with sterility and intention.
  The language of computer science and mathematics is contained,
  and so when studyinig data structures, we are given a complete
  understanding of them through the perspective of deductive logic.
  So for example, we can theoretically define and completely
  understand the concept of <b>memory</b> from the perspective of bits.
  This to me seems like a good apprach to epistemology.
</p>
<p>
  In that vein, my goal in life is to help create the
  first artificial intelligence.  I believe AI will be a profound good
  for the world,so long as it is designed with the ultimate care,
  discretion, and patience.
  I have always been fascinated by intelligence, and I believe this undertaking
  will be a great exercise in epistemology and give us a better sense of what
  it means to know, to understand, so on. A direct consequence of this
  would be a full a complete understanding of a our brain, the most complex
  object in the universe.
</p>
<p> I have always believed in The Great Book and in their power
  (erroneous perhaps) to make a person more considerate, kind,
  thoughtful, curious--a better person.
  This has subsequently engendered an appreciation for language.
  There is an incredible amount of cheap, misinformed ornamentation
  in my writing (verbage, nested-clauses, etc.).
  I am not the biggest fan, and I hope to improve by starting a
  repository for my writings (writings.html) on my website.
</p>
<p>
  But this appreciatation for language resulted in my finding my specific speciality
  in AI rather quickly: Natural Language Processing and Language-Embeddings.
</p>
<p>
  I hope to get a PhD in Computer Science specializing in the subfield
  of language embeddings.
  Therefore, my interests really fall in the field of natural language Processing
  machine learning, topic-modelling, concept recognition, context recognition,
  and vectorized word representations. A few of my favorite papers are
  Distributed Representations of Words (Tomas Mikolov et. al),
  Latent Dirichelect Allocation (David Blei et al),
  kAnchor Words (Sanjeev Arora et al).

<p> On here you will find my projects, including my Textual Factors Library,
  which is currently being used by numberous faculty at the Univrsity of Chicago
  Booth School of Busines. Also found here are creations I make for fun, including video games,
  a Craiglist job search program, and new algorithms for uncovering word embeddings.
  I am also currently implementing a few papers that I plan to post in this section.

  Writing is a muscle, and will atrophe when neglected.
  I have tried to write everyday, and have failed consistently.
  Finally I made the modest promise to write everday for a month.
  I am now moving to digitize my journaling for ease and as a way to practice my
  ability in running secure databases. This will require a login, for which I will be the only
  account holder. When I can afford it, I will run my own server, which will hopefully
  allow other users to create accounts and maintain their own blogs on my site,
  providing a small-bussiness alternative to the mooses at WordPress<sup>TM</sup>.
